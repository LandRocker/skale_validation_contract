## About

LandRocker is a unique Play-to-Earn game about discovery and space exploration. As a player, you'll embark on a thrilling journey through intergalactic space to launch exhilarating mining missions to uncover rare and valuable resources such as NFTs, crypto tokens, and crafting materials. With your earnings, you can craft your own NFTs and trade them on the marketplace.
LandRocker is the only Play to Earn platform that uses blockchain technology at the core of its reward distribution and validation system. Rewards are hidden using Smart Contracts, making their location unpredictable even to the platform's developers. This provides complete trust & transparency and ensures that there is no room for speculation as to the fairness of reward distribution.
Each Planet offers enticing rewards, with varying Fuel costs for entry. These rewards are hidden within different blockchains, ensuring integrity and unpredictability. LandRocker showcases its capability to validate rewards across any blockchain, demonstrating the technology's versatility.
